Project brief: A spin rotation geometry using grasshopper.

Description: Description: Spin geometry require inputs for  direction in (x,y plane ),count and radius. The Sliders for the mentioned inputs are ranging as follow :
Direction x (0-20)
Direction y(0-20)
Count (0-100)
Radius (0-5)
Process require evaluate surface of the original rectangular geometry. Then apply the point charges and spin forces. The output geometry also have a gradient colour component attached to the representing surface.
